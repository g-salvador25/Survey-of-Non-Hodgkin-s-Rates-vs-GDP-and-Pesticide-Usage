# Survey of the Correlation Between Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, GDP, and Pesticides

## Project Description:

The purpose of our application is to find whether or not a correlation exists between pesticides and NHL rates within
countries that utilize these products. We used data mostly from SpringerLink report because it had all the global data
we needed to compare the mean of NHL rates in each country listed. 


## Instructions on how to use our code:

1. Ensure the required CSV files are in the same directory (folder) as the Jupyter Notebook file
2. If any package is not installed, delete the quotations at the top of the first cell along with the message.


## How to Use the Project: 

1. Go through all the menu options to explore the data and results. 
2. For options 1-3, you can explore different categories vs. NHL rates. 
3. For option 4, you can view the overall results and download them if needed. 
4. When you're done, press 5 to quit the program. 

## Troubleshooting: 

If the data files or program menu create an error, restart the kernel and run each cell again. 
Ensure that “Restart & Run All” is clicked rather than “Restart & Clear Output”.
